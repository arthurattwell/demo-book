    Bettercare Test: Sub-chapter heading</h1><h2 id="f22111e7-1d0a-cbc8-b6e0-a3b1500e64f2">1-1 Is this a test 'article' heading?</h2><p>Why, yes it is. And this is what we call article text for the Bettercare Test book. Article text is usually a few lines long. In rare cases it can be as much as a couple of pages in a printed book, and can include bulleted and numbered lists, nested lists, quotations and so on. Most articles include key concepts and some include notes. Examples of those below.</p><dl class="definition"><dt></dt><dd>For Bettercare books, we use the definition element for key concepts. This is largely because we want to use standard HTML elements for all our features, and it's the HTML element best matched to what we need a key concept box/callout to do.</dd></dl><p class="">The article text may continue after a key concept or note.</p><div class="note"><span class="title"></span><p>This is a note, extra text that is of interest but not crucial to the core concept being taught.</p></div><h2 id="74042da9-4c62-2bdd-ff09-2da3c6df4038">1-2 Is this a second test article heading?</h2><p>Indeed! As you can see, we number article headings manually (not using HTML ordered lists). This avoids problems with auto-numbering getting out of sync with cross-references to specific articles.</p><h1 id="14ab53b3-6196-ab2c-2ae1-d5fbbd0f0758">Bettercare Test: Second sub-chapter heading</h1><h2>1-3 Yet another article heading?</h2><p>Oh yes. There are about 50 articles per chapter. Sometimes there are sub-chapter headings, sometimes not.</p><p>For cross-references, we just format as italics. Later, we may make it a clickable link for browser-type reading environments. We do not use a specific HTML element or class. For example the next paragraph is a cross reference.</p><p><em>See 1-2 for an example of an article.</em></p><h2>1-4 And then articles just continue?</h2><p>Yup. More and more of them.</p></body>
